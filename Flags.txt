Flag Types

	Control Flags
	- Controls CPU Operation
	- Can perform more risky tasks
	- Can set these to control the mode and operation of the CPI

	Status Flag
	- Reflects the outcome of arithmetic and logical operations performed by the CPU
	- Codes:
		- Overflow(OF), occurs when a signed arithmetic operation is too large to fit into the destination variable/register
		- Sign(SF), occurs when the result of an arithmetic or logical operation is negative
		- Zero(ZF), occurs when the result of an arithmetic or logical operation is zero
		- Carry(CF) occurs when the result of an unsigned arithmetic operation is too large to fit into the destination
		- Parity(PF), occurs when the least significant byte of a result contains an even number of 1 bits
		- Auxiliary Carry(AC), occurs when the arithmetic operation causes a carry from bit 3 to bit 4 in an 8-bit operand
